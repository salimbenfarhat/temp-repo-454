I am building my own customized Framework (Work In Progress) called SBFramework.




## To Do :

~~**- Build feature to destroy Session after logout**~~ 

**- On the refresh page create button to clean db after be logged in**

~~**- Create MCD/SQL for only one user who add posts**~~

**- Create Fake data library or import faker library**

**- Create factories and seeders for users/posts**

**- Create Session Class on the framework repo**

**- Think how to create models / manage db requests**  

**- Create auth system with the following features :** 
- **Signup page with email field / password field / confirm password field and pincode field**
Add feature to check if the mail exist or not in the DB  
Add feature to hide/display password/pincode  
Add link to generate securized password randomly  
Add link to generate pincode
Add feature to send signup activation mail link after signup and where its expire after one hour if not clicked
Add feature to send random code to activate manually instead of passing by the reset signup activation link

Add feature to check if the ID(email or username) exist in database
- **"Forgot your password?" page**
